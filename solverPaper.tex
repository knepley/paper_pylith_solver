\section{Introduction}

\section{Methodology}

The two solvers presented below make use of the same basic pieces: a separation of the various physicsal fields, a multilevel decomposition, basic iterative methods, and direct solvers. The methods differ in their nested structure, and the scale at which each piece is applied. These choices can be crucial for efficient performance on different architectures and in different rheological regimes.

\subsection{Global Block Solver}

Recall that the equations for a prescribed-slip fault embedded in an elastic medium can be represented linear algebraically as
\begin{align}
  \mqty( E & C \\ C^T & 0) \mqty(u \\ \lambda) = \mqty(f \\ d)
\end{align}
where $E$ is the elastic operator, $C$ describes the slip constraints, $u$ is the displacement field, $\lambda$ the total fault stress, $f$ the elastic body forces, and $d$ the slip distribution. We can globally apply a Schur complement scheme to this matrix using the PETSc FieldSplit preconditioner~\cite{petsc-user-ref,bkmms2012}. Using the full factorization, our preconditioner has the form
\begin{align}
  \mqty( I & -\hat E^{-1} C \\ 0 & I) \mqty(\hat E^{-1} & 0 \\ 0 & \hat S^{-1}) \mqty(I & 0 \\ -C^T \hat E^{-1} & I)
\end{align}
where the Schur Complement $S$ is defined by
\begin{align}
  S = -C^T \hat E^{-1} C
\end{align}
and we have used $\hat A^{-1}$ to indicate an approximate solve for the operator $A$.

The elastic operator can be efficiently inverted using multigrid. Algebraic multigrid (AMG) works well, both ML and GAMG in PETSc, but has some setup penalty. If the mesh is uniformly refined, we can use geometric multigrid for the refinement levels, and then use AMG for the coarse solve. The Schur Complement solve requires a preconditioner for $S$, but it is represented implicitly. The \texttt{selfp} option in PETSc uses the diagonal of $E$ to approximate $S$ for a preconditioning matrix. In our experiments, the convergence of this choice degrades with increasing fault size.

\subsection{Global Multigrid}

We can instead invert the relation between multigrid and block solvers, using multigrid as the overarching solver and block algorithms for the smoothers. The most important consideration is to accurately capture coupling across the fault interface. Pointwise smoothers fail completely in this respect.

We construct the fine grid smoother by first reordering the unknowns so that dofs duplicated by the introduced faults are adjacent. Since the mesh ordering is generally good for banding, the reordering transformation is a greedy algorithm on top of the original ordering. Next we combine unknowns coupled by fault cohesive cells into blocks, which is stored by the PETSc matrix object by marking the start of each block. This blocking is then used by the Variable Point-Block Jacobi (VPBJACOBI) preconditioner to extract and invert these fault blocks. This smoother can be selected for the AMG fine grid, and easily compared with standard choices. In fact, the entire solver can be dynamically assembled at runtime from command line options.

Consider the following mesh with two cohesive cells comprising one fault,

where we have introduced a fault gap purely to show explicitly the cohesive cells, which in the simulation have zero volume. In~\cref{fig:sparsityC}, we display the sparsity pattern of our operator highlighting only the $C$ and $C^T$ matrices. The red and blue entries indicate the two sides of the fault, which are distinguished by positive and negative terms. The top panel is the sparsity in the original mesh ordering, whereas the bottom has grouped unknowns coupled by cohesive cells into two fault blocks, followed by the usual elastic blocks of size two. We can see the blocking for this mesh in output from PETSc:

This solver is particularly well-suited to GPUs, as the VPBJACOBI preconditioner has been optimized for this architecture by the libCEED team~\cite{brownbarrabeamsghaffariknepleymosesshakeristengelthompsonzhang2022}
